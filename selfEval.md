# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly    been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

> Well, challenging lol. Never having done anything like this sort of work or stuff has been highly educating for sure. I've had to refine my searching parameters alot to adjust for my lack of knowledge around the subjects and terms but I think it's good exposure for what we'll have to do in the real world. I've spent far to long looking for a simple answer because I was asking the wrong quesiton so, I think the biggest lesson for my is that if I'm not finding an answer I need to take another look at the problem.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

> I'm staying engaged well enough to be sure and taking breaks as needed but I do need to get a handle on my ergonomics situation as sitting at the counter or table in the kitchen is not good for my posture or hip flexors lol.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?

> That syntax matters lol. There's been more than one time that I've missed a comma and it broke stuff so I need to do a sweep of my stuff before I run it.
